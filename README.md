# Factorio: Space Shuttle
When playing Factorio with Earendel's Space Exploration mod, I never understood why there only is spacewalking in orbit.

This mod adds a space shuttle (based on the cargo plane) when the mod aircraft is installed.

Feel free to review and improve my code.

## Known issues
- The models look very bad: yes they do, feel free to make a pull request with improved gfx.
- There might be issues when adding the mod to an existing game
